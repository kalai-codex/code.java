# Java Variables

Variables in Java are used to store data values. Every variable has a **type**, **name**, and can store a **value**.

##  Syntax

<type> <variableName> = <value>;

Example:
int age = 25;
double salary = 55000.50;
String name = "Kalai";
boolean isStudent = true;


Types of Variables

1️ **Primitive Types**  
- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- char
- boolean

2️ **Non-Primitive Types (Reference Types)**
- String
- Arrays
- Objects

3.Rules for Naming Variables
  Must start with a letter, `_`, or `$`  
  Cannot start with a digit  
  Case-sensitive (age ≠ Age)  
  No spaces


## Types of Variables 
     1️. Local Variables
- Declared inside methods, constructors, or blocks.
- Scope is limited to that method or block.
- Must be initialized before use.

Example:
void show() {
    int count = 10;  // local variable
    System.out.println(count);
}
    2.Instance Variables
Declared inside a class, but outside any method.
Each object has its own copy.
Also called non-static fields.

Example:
public class Student {
    String name;    // instance variable
    int age;        // instance variable
}
   3.Static Variables (Class Variables)
Declared with the static keyword.
Shared by all objects of the class.
Memory is allocated once when the class is loaded.

Example:
public class Student {
    static String schoolName = "ABC School";  // static variable
}
